              MakeSmile, an initiative by the Drishti Rotaract Club of BPIT, aims
              to bridge the gap between the privileged and underprivileged by
              connecting people who have extra toys and books with children in
              need. The mission is to redistribute these resources to children who
              may not have access to such items, spreading joy and offering
              support to underprivileged communities. Through this initiative,
              MakeSmile fosters compassion and promotes equality, ensuring that
              every child has the opportunity to enjoy childhood essentials like
              toys and books while contributing to their overall development and
              happiness.
